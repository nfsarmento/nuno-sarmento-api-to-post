Simple WP API to Posts

== Description ==

Nuno Sarmento API To Post is the simplest way to get WordPress Posts from a remote WordPress website. The plugin fetches posts from a remote website using WP API and display them in very slick and gorgeous two grid layout.

Add your API URL on NS API To Post admin page ( example http://example:example@example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/?_embed ) please don't forget to add ?_embed on your url.

I have tried to keep this plugin as simple as possible, you are not going to be overwhelmed with options like some of the API plugins out there.

At this stage I haven't implemented every  API To Post feature, but if there is a feature that you'd really like to see, please let me know.
